  <p> Hi, my name is Talia. Welcome to my porfolio where I will post my latest works of text, audio, video and photography. I'm 19 and originally from San Francisco, California. I moved to New York City last year and attend Eugene Lang College at The New School. Growing up as a city kid, I finds the sights and sounds of the city to be very gratifying and often displays this theme through her work.</p>
